# Library_Search
Library search engine using data structures. Made as a mini-project for IT-602 (Object Oriented Programming and Dat Structures) at DA-IICT. 

The project uses Trie data structure for prefix-based search and other data structures like HashMaps and ArrayList are used as and when required.

Currently the search engine only searches by author and book names.
